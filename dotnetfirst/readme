// struct vs class


//class
class is blueprint of the object which contains propert and behavior of the object
class is used for the complex data structure and when we need to implement inheritance and polymorphism abstraction features

class is used when we want to work with reference types




//Struct

struct is somewhat similat to class , but struct is used when we want to group similiar data 
and when we want to work with small data structures and make simple programs that does not require features like inheritance and polymorphism.

struct are value type  , so they are much efficient in memory management than classes
struct can not implement inheritance but it can implement interfaces.




//enums
enums are used to group the related constants in a more concise and clear way.
each member of enum has an inetger value associated with it.
we can not created method inside it




in polymorphism , we can call data members of the base class from derived class by giving reference of base class to the object of derived class

structs are inpmlicityly sealed , so we can not inherit them
